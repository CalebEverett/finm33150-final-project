1. More sophisticated hedging - other than one to one - is this really effective given the reversion to no spread?
2. More leverage - first step would be to leverage the spot position at 65% loan to value - 0.24% interest cost per day plus added complexity of needing to rebalance.
3. Use futures to go long and short different tokens using the correlation to hedge the spread while capturing the funding rate from one token with a positive funding rate by being short and the funding rate from another one with a negative funding rate by being long and using cross margin to minimize the amount of rebalancing
